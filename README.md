## 📌 Project Objective

Analyze social media data (Twitter) to:

- Understand public sentiment on various brands and topics.
- Identify trends and patterns in user feedback.
- Develop a predictive sentiment classification model using machine learning.

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed

- **Loaded and explored** a large labeled Twitter dataset.
- **Text preprocessing** including:
  - Lowercasing
  - Tokenization
  - Stopword removal
  - Punctuation removal
- **Sentiment Classification** using:
  - VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
  - Categories: `Positive`, `Negative`, `Neutral`
- **Visualization** using:
  - Seaborn & Matplotlib (sentiment distribution)
  - WordCloud (most frequent words)
- **Model building** with:
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Achieved **92% accuracy**

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Positive sentiment** slightly dominated the dataset overall.
- Certain **countries and topics** showed spikes in **negative sentiment**, notably:
  - `RedDeadRedemption2`
  - `Facebook`
  - `Battlefield`
- WordClouds revealed trending keywords and user behavior.
- Model performed well in detecting sentiment in unseen tweets, demonstrating strong generalizability.
