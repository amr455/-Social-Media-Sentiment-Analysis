# 🔍 Task 2 Completed | Social Media Sentiment Analysis using NLP
 📍 Data Analytics Internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions 

I’m excited to share the second task in my internship journey at Brainwave Matrix, where I worked on analyzing public sentiment from social media using NLP techniques and machine learning. 🚀

📌 Project Goal:
 To extract and analyze sentiment from over 74,000+ tweets related to various topics and brands with Random Forest Classifier to build a model with 92% accuracy
 

✅ Loaded & explored a labeled Twitter dataset
✅ Cleaned and preprocessed text (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
✅ Applied VADER sentiment analysis to classify tweets into Positive, Negative, and Neutral
✅ Visualized sentiment distribution using Seaborn and Matplotlib
✅ Created a Word Cloud of most used words in tweets
✅ Used TF-IDF Vectorizer + Random Forest Classifier to build a model with 92% accuracy

📊 Key Insights:
Positive sentiment slightly dominated the dataset.
Certain countries and topics had disproportionately high negative feedback.
("RedDeadRedembtion2","Facebook","Battelfield") was the top3
Word clouds revealed interesting user behavior and hot topics.
